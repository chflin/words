Dear Sir/Madam,
I am writing to confirm the financial status of Capstone, a corporation licensed under Type 9 (Asset Management) by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). As per the Securities and Futures (Financial Resources) Rules (FRR), Capstone is required to maintain sufficient liquid capital at all times to comply with regulatory standards. Specifically, as a Type 9 licensed corporation is required to maintain a minimum liquid capital of HK$100,000 at all times.
This mandatory requirement ensures that Capstone consistently holds adequate liquid capital to meet its obligations, in line with the SFCâ€™s regulatory framework. Please note that I do not have, and the company will not provide, our financial statements. However, we hope you can accept that Capstone maintains a sound financial status, as this is a strict requirement enforced by the SFC.
Should you require further details or documentation, please do not hesitate to contact me.
